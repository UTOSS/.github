## Divisions

UTOSS has three distinct divisions: Software, Hardware, and Outreach.

4. A teaching-focused showpiece team

### Outreach

The Outreach division is responsible for all public facing aspects of the club,
such as:

1. The club website
1. The club social media accounts
   1. LinkedIn
   1. Instagram
1. This README

All of these aspects are run and managed in an open source github-based manner.

## Join Us!

To join our club, we ask that you:

become a full member of the club in no time!
